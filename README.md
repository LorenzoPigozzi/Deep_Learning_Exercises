Project: "Face mask classification: are you wearing mask?"

The objective of the project was the creation of a Deep Neural Network from scratch.
Starting form a collection of pictures, the team developed an algorithm in order to classify people with or without face-masks, commonly used in this Covid period. 
The architecture implemented was a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which achieved a very good result based on the metrics used for the assessment phase.
The technical informations, the context, the data sources and the choices for the architecture are explained in the report.
